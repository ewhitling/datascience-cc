## Hydrogen
There are two versions of the notebook files. The iPython notebooks (.ipynb) and
the Hydrogen text files (prefix w/ "hydrogen_") in the hydrogen folder.
Hydrogen is a notebook environment for Atom text editor.
I particularly like the Hydrogen approach, it is based on the forwarding
thinking from an IDE called Light Table by Bret Victor.  Go read about it!

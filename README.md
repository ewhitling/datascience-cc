# Data Science Crash Course
## Introduction

## Environment / Install

## Hydrogen
There are two versions of the notebook files. The iPython notebooks (.ipynb) and
the Hydrogen text files (prefix w/ "hydrogen_") in the hydrogen folder. Hydrogen is a notebook environment
for Atom text editor. I particularly like the Hydrogen approach, it is based on the
forwarding thinking from an IDE called Light Table by Bret Victor.  Go read about it!
